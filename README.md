# Autocharging
Use a smart plug to automatically turn the laptop's charging on and off

Why do this?

I made this application as my laptop is ususally connected for charging whenever I am using it. The battery stays fully charged for most of the time which is not good for it's life and increases the chances of the battery swelling up. So to keep the laptop's battery cycle instead of being charged 100% all the time I made this Spring boot application.
