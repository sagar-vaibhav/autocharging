# Autocharging
Use a smart plug to automatically turn the laptop's charging on and off.

Why do this?

To keep the laptop's battery cycling instead of staying charged at 100% for laptops that are usually kept connected to a
power source for long durations.

Prerequisites – Smart plug, Android/iPhone, a computer to run the application with Java 8 or above.

1.	Install app the app Smart Life – Smart Living

Note - You can also use any other app that is supported by IFTTT for controlling smart devices.
